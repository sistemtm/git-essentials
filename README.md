# git-essentials

## Deployment notes
I'm Kalob Taulien — your instructor for this course. I've been using Git for well over 5 years now and I've seen it used in every possible scenario. And the honest truth is: it is not very complicated. I promise you will learn how to use Git and GitHub fluently in just a couple of hours.

## Staging notes
Git is used in almost every software development company. Whether you're creating websites, making games, or creating desktop programs — Git is being used! 

## How to use this repo notes
Every website I've made in the last 5 years uses Git. GitHub is the brand name for Git services. But there's also GitLab which lets companies host their own Git service — but they are used the exact same way. Every command you see in this course can be used on GitLab, GitHub and BitBucket. It's 100% interchangeable.
